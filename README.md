# Traffic Flow Simulation Project

## Overview
For this project, I will be provided with a significant amount of code to start with. This is very different from previous projects where I might be given only function prototypes, and I would essentially be starting from scratch. The provided classes and code will allow me to avoid spending too much time on high-level design, but I will need to spend some time understanding the provided code and how the code I will be adding will work with it.

In general, this project should be less time-consuming compared to a "start from scratch" project, and will allow me to focus on the simulation aspects instead of spending too much time on file reading, error checking, or determining which attributes my `EventClass` should have. Since the end of the semester is quickly approaching, this approach provides a good opportunity to gain experience with an event-driven simulation, as well as working with someone else’s code—just as would be the case in a team-based environment.

This project involves the implementation of an event-driven simulation of traffic flow through a 4-way intersection managed by a traffic light. The simulation will include cars arriving at the intersection from all four directions, and the traffic light changing state throughout the simulation. At the end of the simulation, I will output some minimal statistics about the traffic flow.

## Key Components
- **Event-Driven Simulation**: The project will focus on simulating events such as car arrivals and traffic light state changes.
- **Traffic Intersection**: The simulation will model a 4-way intersection with cars traveling in all four directions.
- **Traffic Light Management**: I will implement a system to manage the state changes of the traffic light as part of the simulation.
- **Minimal Traffic Statistics**: After the simulation concludes, minimal traffic flow statistics will be output, such as the number of cars passing through the intersection in each direction.

## Objectives
- **Code Understanding**: I need to study the provided code, including the classes and event management components.
- **Simulation Logic**: I will implement the logic to handle traffic flow and light state changes in response to events.
- **Output Statistics**: At the end of the simulation, I will ensure that basic traffic flow statistics are output.

## Expected Deliverables
- **Completed Simulation Code**: I will implement the event-driven simulation to handle traffic flow and traffic light state changes.
- **Statistics Output**: I will ensure that a report summarizing the results of the simulation, including statistics about traffic flow, is generated at the end.
